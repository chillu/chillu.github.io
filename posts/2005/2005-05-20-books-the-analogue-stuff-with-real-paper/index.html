<p>As you may know, I’m currently traveling about three hours a day to
Wiesbaden where <a href=http://www.s-v.de>Scholz & Volkmer</a> is located.
It’s amazing how many stuff you’re able to read on such trips – my
last “week-portion” was a whole year-volume of
<a href=http://www.wired.com>Wired Magazine</a>! Same goes for books: I’m
devouring them, and have become a regular at Amazon. Amongst
others, there’s this one special book I’d like to share:
<a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552151742/qid=1116620373/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/028-8316332-0499764">A short history of nearly everything”</a>
by Bill Bryson. It’s a science book, which covers everything from
Big Bang to Atomic Age in 600 pages. Even if you’re not
scientifically engaged (though you should be as a self-respecting
geek <strong>g</strong>), it’s a really apalling read with truckloads of
information. I’ve only got halfway through Stephen Hawking’s “Short
history of time” and never liked the authorative title of Dietrich
Schwanitz’ “Bildung”, but Mr. Bryson really knows how to combine
facts with metaphors, anecdotes and personal storys. So, if you
read one non-fiction book this year, buy this one :) (and for the
lazy ones: the
<a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3442310024/qid=1116621190/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_11_1/028-8316332-0499764">german version</a>,
which unfortunately nearly triples in price).</p>
<p>To give you a notion of the writing-style, here’s the very first
lines from the book which already caught me: “Welcome. And
congratulations. I am delighted that you could make it. Getting
here wasn’t easy, I know. In fact, I suspect it was a little
tougher than you realize. To begin with, for you to be here now
trillions of drifting atoms had somehow to assemble in an intricate
and curiously obliging manner to create you. It’s an arrangement so
specialized and particular that is has never been tried before and
will only exist this once. For the next many years (we hope) these
tiny particles will uncomplainingly engage in all the billions of
deft, co-operative efforts necessary to keep you intact and let you
epxerience the supremely agreeable but generally under appreciated
state known as existence.”</p>
