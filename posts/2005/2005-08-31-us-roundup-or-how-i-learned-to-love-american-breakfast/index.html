<p>To keep me from falling asleep in mid-day due to jetlag, I’m
compiling some words on my trip. This won’t be a lenghty day-by-day
travel-story, I promise – just some things that come to my mind.
For the record, I’ve been to: San Francisco, Zion National Park,
Bryce Canyon, Laughlin, Las Vegas, Laughlin, Grand Canyon, Sedona,
Los Angeles, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, Carmel.</p>
<p><strong>Nature</strong> At some places, you can randomly point your camera
somewhere, and every shot seems
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/36715938/in/set-779963/>like a postcard</a>
– nature in California and Nevada is rough, beautiful and always
with a glazing blue sky. At length, it’s even a bit too much –
after seeing so much impressive nature, Grand Canyon was just
“another kinda big valley”.</p>
<p><strong>Civilisation</strong> I love the way Americans deal with “public
design”:
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/37485063/in/set-779963/>totally</a>
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/38525828/in/set-779963/>weird</a>
traffic-signage, very colorful storefronts and emergency-cars that
look like they’re out of a museum. Everybody seems to be crazy
about
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/36716006/in/set-779963/>giant shiny cars</a>
– most of the SUVs on the streets could easily transport a Smart in
their trunk…The waste of energy and water is hilarious: It’s one
thing to build a two-million-city like Las Vegas far off in the
desert. But Americans don’t give a damn about recycling their
precious goods, even if they have to import everything hundreds of
miles into the desert: E.g., in most restaurants, plates and dishes
are plastics, thrown away together with dinner-leftovers and
glass-bottles – WTF?!. Another thing: Apple is everywhere!
Windows-laptops are the absolute minority in hotel-lobbys etc., and
you can’t drive two miles without hitting a
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/36716076/in/set-779963/>larger-than-life iPod-ad</a>
– it’s fantastic ;D Then, Americans try to imitate europe whereever
they can: hotels look like english 19th-century golf-clubs, the
waitresses proud themselves with their “coffee from Holland” (I
always knew the best coffee-regions are at the north-sea…<strong>g</strong>). In
Vegas, Malls and Hotels are mini-replicas of Paris or Venice,
complete with
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/36715963/in/set-779963/>indoor sunsets</a>
– just, well…crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Customs</strong> American breakfast (ham, eggs, sirup, bacon, muffins,
fruits) rocks! I hardly eat any breakfast, but I bet I would be fat
as a whale if all that was common in Germany ;)</p>
<p><strong>Places</strong> I never thought I would say that…Vegas is the place to
be! I played only once, winning 45$ out of 5$ – I’m hooked ;) If I
ever would choose to live at the U.S. westcoast, it’d probably look
something like this: doing my master at UCSB in Santa Barbara
(beauuutiful indy-student seaside-town), work a few years in Palo
Alto (or Cupertino), win some millions in Vegas and retire in
Sedona (always-sunny and quiet creek-town).</p>
<p>OK, so everything in the U.S. seems to be
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/37007022/in/set-779963/>bigger</a>,
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/35471790/in/set-779963/>colder</a>,
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/37009599/in/set-779963/>hotter</a>,
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/37485008/in/set-779963/>fatter</a>,
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/37009663/in/set-779963/>sweeter</a>,
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/37485208/in/set-779963/>cheaper</a>,
low-carb-ier,
<a href=http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/36715978/in/set-779963/>more colorful</a>
– but better? Hm, I’m happy to be back in good old Germany, to be
honest ;)</p>
