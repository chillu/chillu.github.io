<p>On the way back to Germany I had a little “asia-preview” by staying
in Singapore for two nights. As so often, the internet was very
useful for figuring out to do in this timespan, and so I followed a
wiki-based itinary from <a href>wikitravel</a>.<br>
Day 1 was dedicated to shopping on Orchard Street, a 2km-street
with at least a dozen multi-storey shopping malls – it actually
took me the better part of the day to walk through it. As I
couldn’t think of any electronics I could buy cheaper there, I got
through it without spending much (apart from an awesome <a href>robopet</a>
for my godson). I saw at huge armada of electronic-shops on the
way, selling everything from cellphone-covers over phonecards to
digicams – sometimes as many as five on a single mall-floor.
Interesting sidenote: Lots of asians switch to badass digital SLRs,
with 600mm-lenses, external flash and all the shebang (I’m getting
rid of mine, because its just too bulky to carry around).<br>
So my first impression of the city wasn’t too overwhelming, with
lots of concrete and in-your-face capitalism (“world’s only
shopping mall with a seat in the United Nations”). Although it’s a
very safe city, I feld kinda awkward being in a place where a death
penalty is executed every six days in average (way more than in
China), on relatively low charges as trafficking 500g of
marihuana.<br>
After an exhausting afternoon with unbearable humidity I was ready
to sample some Singaporean food – and tried the highly recommended
“<a href>black pepper crab</a>”. It was quite a fight between us two, with
pityful waiters bringing me more napkins because my hands were
nearly black with soy sauce – fun times!<br>
Day 2 proved to be more cultural and interesting: Chinatown with
its innumerous booths selling <a href>random</a> <a href>stuff</a>, and a very
crowded Little India – I must have seen the whole male indian
population of Singapore chatting on the space of three blocks,
without any apparent reason for gathering. Had an in-depth personal
introduction into the art of Japanese tea-brewing (at
<a href>Tea Chapter</a>), a very formalized process with lots of utilities.
Today my culinary choices were “<a href>tea eggs</a>” and shark fins –
couldn’t get me to try the <a href>fishhead curry</a>.<br>
I really wanted to try asian pastry as well, but couldn’t go near
any bakery – because they mostly sell some weird fruit called
“<a href>durian</a>” there, with a sweet smell unbearable for most
europeans. The smell is so bad that its actually <a href>forbidden</a> to
bring the fruit on the subway haha.<br>
The public transport in Singapore is awesome, with
<a href>modern stations</a>, prepaid ticket-cards and a well-planned
network its super-easy to get around in the city.<br>
So overall Singapore left a pretty mixed picture, no place I would
want to live (especially because of the authoritarian regime) – but
definetly worth a two-day stop.<br>
Good read on Singapore in Wired Magazine:
