<p>Do you still remember
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_gore>Al Gore</a>? I just stumbled
over a
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2565436963450479963">flaming pledge for environmental protection</a>
by this former vice-president of the U.S.. It’s not only a stunning
example of a well-prepared presentation, but also contains very
interesting insights by a man who <strong>nearly</strong> became head of the
american administration – and even if he would talk more moderate
if he actually won the election, there is still hope…<br>
In fact the presentation was so good that somebody made a movie
around it: <a href=http://climatecrisis.net>An Inconvenient Truth</a>
(<a href=http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount_classics/aninconvenienttruth/>Trailer on apple.com</a>),
which is released in the U.S. these days (unfortunately we still
have to wait until September to see it in Germany). [via
<a href=http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/05/al_gore_another.html>Presentation Zen: “Al Gore – another presenter extraordinaire?”</a>]</p>
<p>P.S.: Al Gore sits on the board of directors at Apple Computer
Inc., which earns him some extra points of course ;)</p>
