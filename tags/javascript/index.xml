Silverstripe is a product of over a hundred individual repos, and my contributions are scattered among them (see my github.com/silverstripe contribution timeline).
There were a few major areas of focus over the years for myself, with the help of many open source contributors:</description></item><item><title>Github Issue Tracker</title><link>http://www.chillu.com/projects/silverstripe-issue-tracker/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.chillu.com/projects/silverstripe-issue-tracker/</guid><description>VueJS frontend to aggregate Github issues through their GraphQL API, deployed on Vercel</description></item><item><title>Alexa Skill for New Zealand Earthquakes</title><link>http://www.chillu.com/projects/alexa-skill-kiwi-quakes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.chillu.com/projects/alexa-skill-kiwi-quakes/</guid><description>https://github.com/chillu/alexa-skill-kiwi-quakes
New Zealanders often ask themselves: Was that an earthquake, a truck going past, or just the wind? Now you can ask Alexa!
&amp;ldquo;Alexa, ask kiwi quakes if this was an earthquake&amp;rdquo;
Under the hood, it uses AWS Lambda functions deployed through the Serverless Framework.
I should acknowledge the awesome New Zealand GeoNet project and its sponsors EQC, GNS Science and LINZ, for providing data used in this app.</description></item><item><title>Echt: A social network based on face recognition</title><link>http://www.chillu.com/projects/echt-face-recognition-social-network/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.chillu.com/projects/echt-face-recognition-social-network/</guid><description>On Github: server and client
Worked with my good friend @bnolan to realise his idea for a minimalistic social network based on selfies and facial recognition. In short, you join by taking a photo, and you &amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; someone by taking a selfie with them. Being physically in the same space with the other person is a feature, not a bug. We&amp;rsquo;ve taken this idea to PoC stage and tested it with a few friends, before it lost steam.</description></item><item><title>Talk: Fitting GraphQL into a CMS data model (Wellington PHP Meetup 2017)</title><link>http://www.chillu.com/posts/2017/talk-fitting-graphql-in-a-cms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.chillu.com/posts/2017/talk-fitting-graphql-in-a-cms/</guid><description>Lightning talk for the Wellington PHP Meetup, about the challenges of matching an ActiveRecord style ORM in a PHP-based CMS with GraphQL&amp;rsquo;s type language.

Allows users to suggest videos by pasting in their URLs. The app will automatically retrieve and list details on the video via the oEmbed protocol. By authenticating via Github, users can also vote on videos.
The use case for this app is company-internal &amp;ldquo;lunch and learn&amp;rdquo; sessions, where a group of devs get together to watch interesting conference talks. This was used in &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; at Silverstripe for a number of years.</description></item></channel></rss>
