Worked with my good friend @bnolan to realise his idea for a minimalistic social network based on selfies and facial recognition. In short, you join by taking a photo, and you &amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; someone by taking a selfie with them. Being physically in the same space with the other person is a feature, not a bug. We&amp;rsquo;ve taken this idea to PoC stage and tested it with a few friends, before it lost steam.</description></item><item><title>Talk: GraphQL in SilverStripe - Reasons and Demo App (Stripecon Malta 2017)</title><link>http://www.chillu.com/posts/2017/talk-stripecon-eu-2017/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.chillu.com/posts/2017/talk-stripecon-eu-2017/</guid><description>Talk at Stripecon Malta in 2017.

Allows users to suggest videos by pasting in their URLs. The app will automatically retrieve and list details on the video via the oEmbed protocol. By authenticating via Github, users can also vote on videos.
The use case for this app is company-internal &amp;ldquo;lunch and learn&amp;rdquo; sessions, where a group of devs get together to watch interesting conference talks. This was used in &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; at Silverstripe for a number of years.</description></item></channel></rss>
