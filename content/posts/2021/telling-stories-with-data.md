I've been a steward for a reasonably large open source community ([Silverstripe CMS](https://silverstripe.org)) for over a decade.
My various roles working at the main sponsor of this community ([Silverstripe Ltd](https://silverstripe.com))
put me in a privileged position to talk to many awesome folks in this community,
and influence the direction of the product. But along the way, I've also accumulated
a lot of anecdotes, bias and gut feel about the "shape" of our community and its contributions.
This is especially true when applied to a global community when looking out from our little "filter bubble"
at the headquarters in Wellington, New Zealand.

In 2021, my interests in data wrangling and telling stories with it converged
with a need for some clarity around the health of this community.
Using [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) and
[Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com), I was able to surface
these complex relationships to a wide range of people, with many surprising insights to myself and others.

This post focuses on the approach I have taken to gather and present this data set, rather than interpreting the results.
Since it is 99% based on public data, the [reports](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/12f5e07c-68e0-43a7-9c07-1696bd5230ec/page/X6jOC) is free to view online (updated daily).

## Github's Data Hoarding

Github is the preferred tool for many interactions in open source communities,
especially around code and issues. Thankfully, Github maintains [githubarchive.org](https://www.gharchive.org)
as a "long-term memory" of these interactions in Google BigQuery. Every time a pull request is opened,
an issue is closed, or a comment is submitted, it creates a [Github event](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/).
These events are tracked in a public "big data" set with all of their metadata,
making it a treasure trove for insights.

Each entry will have a few extracted columns and a JSON `payload`:

```js
[
  {
    "id": "16717181616",
    "type": "IssueCommentEvent",
    "created_at": "2021-06-09 23:23:02 UTC",
    "repo_name": "silverstripe/silverstripe-framework",
    "repo_id": "1318892",
    "actor_login": "chillu",
    "actor_id": "111025",
    "org_id": "379348",
    "org_login": "silverstripe",
    "payload": "{\"action\":\"created\",\"issue\":{\"url\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/7509\",\"id\":268206263,\"node_id\":\"MDU6SXNzdWUyNjgyMDYyNjM=\",\"number\":7509,\"title\":\"RFC: Avoid HTTPApplication for CLI\", /*...*/}}"
  },
  /* ... */
]
```

## Ingesting the data

Google BigQuery can be introspected with convenient ANSI SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  type, 
  # ...
  payload
FROM `githubarchive.day.*`
WHERE actor.login = 'chillu';
```

The challenge is that under the hood, it's a **column-based database** rather than row-based database,
which was counterintuitive for me as a Postgres and MySQL user.
A column-based approach scales to extremely large data sets, and provides fast
reads across them while trading off transactional abilities. This makes it a tool of choice
for a data warehouse and the resulting analytics rather than wiring it up to your web application.

The query example above would scan terabytes of data,
because of the inclusion of the (large) `payload` column and the lack of indexes in column-based storage.
Consequently, it would scan far less with a smaller number of columns but the same number of rows.
In the case of the Github Archive, the `payload` is where
all the interesting bits are. And in this service,
a query of this size would cost approximately $50USD to run *once*.

![Githubarchive query](/images/2021-telling-stories-with-data/10tb.png)

Since we only care about events from repositories related to Silverstripe,
a one-off data copy into a separate BigQuery project makes the volumes more manageable at half a million extracted rows.
From this point, new data is ingested daily into this append-only data set via a
[time bound scheduled query](https://gist.github.com/chillu/b63cbf19349986f703e74a749ab8c15e#file-0_community-sql).

## Shaping the data

One of the principles in modern data science is to strive for [tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10):
Each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.
This has served me well for [buying a house with data-driven decisions](/projects/property-trends-dashboard) with R,
aggregating [github issues for machine learning](/projects/github-issue-ml-relevancy) with Python and Pandas data frames,
as well as many internal data warehouse challenges at Silverstripe Ltd.

As a first step, the ingested data is enriched with additional metadata,
and columns extracted from the nested JSON payloads for easier analysis
(see [full query](https://gist.github.com/chillu/b63cbf19349986f703e74a749ab8c15e#file-1_community_extra-sql)).
This happens without changing the "shape" of the data/observation,
and makes the additional columns useable for derived views.

```sql
SELECT
c.*,
JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(payload, '$.action') as action,
JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(payload, '$.ref_type') as ref_type,
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) AS created_at_year,
IF(sm.github IS NOT NULL, TRUE, FALSE) AS is_supported_module,
sm.isCore AS is_core_module,
CASE 
    # Core modules are a *subset* of supported modules
    WHEN sm.isCore THEN 'Core Module'
    WHEN sm.github IS NOT NULL THEN 'Supported Module'
    ELSE 'Community Module'
END AS module_category
# ...
FROM `community` c
LEFT JOIN `supported_modules` sm ON c.repo_id = sm.githubId
```

With these foundations, we can dig into the interesting details.
Here's an abbreviated example showing first and last interactions
of a specific user ("actor"), across all repositories. 
[Common table expressions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#with_clause) through `WITH`
keep things readable, and [window queries](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/analytic-function-concepts)
make it extremly concise to slice data along a group of rows.
This view is used to calculate community tenure trends as well as "churn".

```sql
WITH
actor_interactions AS (
    SELECT
        actor_login,
        COUNT(id) OVER(PARTITION BY actor_login ORDER BY created_at ASC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS interaction_count,
        FIRST_VALUE(created_at) OVER(PARTITION BY actor_login ORDER BY created_at ASC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS first_interaction_date,
        LAST_VALUE(created_at) OVER(PARTITION BY actor_login ORDER BY created_at ASC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_interaction_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY actor_login ORDER BY created_at ASC) AS _rn,
    FROM `community_extra` c
    WHERE
        actor_login IS NOT NULL
        # Only count "substantial" interactions. There's a lot of noise from single event users, e.g. watching a single repo
        AND type IN ('PushEvent', 'IssueCommentEvent', 'IssuesEvent', 'PullRequestEvent', 'PullRequestReviewEvent', 'PullRequestReviewCommentEvent', 'CommitCommentEvent')
    ORDER BY first_interaction_date ASC
),
actor_interactions_normalised AS (
    SELECT
    # ...
    FROM actor_interactions
    WHERE _rn = 1
)

SELECT
    actor_login,
    interaction_count,
    first_interaction_date,
    last_interaction_date,
    DATE_DIFF(DATE(last_interaction_date), DATE(first_interaction_date), YEAR) AS active_years
FROM actor_interactions_normalised
```

## Telling the story

I find that the trick with shaping data is knowing when to stop.
While its convenient to slice and aggregate via SQL,
at some point you'll try to predict all the permutations of how the data is analysed.
It needs to be shaped just enough to be understandable by other users (potentially non-technical),
and in small enough volumes to enable efficient further shaping in more approachable tools
such as business intelligence software. This is where [Google Datastudio](https://datastudio.google.com) comes in
as a reports creator and viewer.

Complex shaping such as the actor interaction example from above keep workloads light
in the reporting view, while producing useful views on semi-raw data.

![Tenure](/images/2021-telling-stories-with-data/tenure_detail.png)

By adding metadata such as "is supported module" to each event
without grouping on this dimension in SQL, the reporting view can
filter this on the fly based on interactive user selections
in permutations that are hard to predict or prescribe.

![Repo highscores](/images/2021-telling-stories-with-data/repo_highscores.png)

Google Datastudio is one of many tools that can be used for this purpose,
but it obviously works really well with Google BigQuery. The schema
of any tables and views is exposed automatically, with sensible
defaults on dimensions and metrics. This is most of the setup required
to drive the filterable table shown above.

![Authoring](/images/2021-telling-stories-with-data/authoring.png)

By combining some inline commentary with auto-updated and interactive data,
these reports become powerful tools to tell an overarching story, but also for this story
to evolve over time. Community members will look at this through a different
lens than their sponsors (often the agencies they work for). Newcomers will
dig for different insights than old hats.

## Conclusion

In this particular situation, I was fortunate to be embedded in a business and community
where I had both the need for data-driven insights, as well as the resources
and skills to get the required foundations in place. 90% of "data science" seems to 
be the retrieval and shaping of data, rather than its interpretation.
It's often not the most glamorous work, but worth it to tell the story.
This is especially true when it leads to conversations with folks who wouldn't be in a position
to get those insights themselves (due to lack of access or technical skills).

I'd like to thank [Dries Buytaert](https://dri.es),
the "founding father" of Drupal (a CMS in friendly competition with Silverstripe).
He's built a system over the years to track contributions in their community,
summarised in annual [who sponsors Drupal](https://dri.es/tag/drupal-sponsors) posts.
This took vision and tenacity, where the resulting data analysis is just the tip of the iceberg.
And it has inspired me to seek out (albeit more limited) insights in our little corner of the open source ecosystem.

*Disclaimer: Unfortunately I can't make the source data derived from gharchive.org
available to provide full transparency,
due to limitations on Google BigQuery permissions. I would have to work with Google
to make it a (sponsored) [public data set](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/).
You're welcome to derive a very similar data set based on the
[queries used](https://gist.github.com/chillu/b63cbf19349986f703e74a749ab8c15e),
or contact me to collaborate and clarify.*
