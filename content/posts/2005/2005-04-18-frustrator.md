I guess I have to delete one entry from my previous
[wanna-work-list](http://www.chillu.com/234/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=48&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=119&cHash=94195506f5)
â€“ Adobe just bought Macromedia! Now one of the most innovative and
web-focused companies around is owned by a print-gigant failing to
be a web-company for years. GREAT! I always respected Macromedia
for not misusing their monopol in Flash-Technology, staying in
close contact with its users and developers, and always astonishing
us with new advances (AS2, FlashPaper, 8Ball). I guess these times
are over. Some other voices:
