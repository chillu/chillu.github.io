As a result of the last few months (with rare blog-entries), I
proudfully present three new projects:
[Kleidermarkt.de](http://chillu.com/299/#kleidermarkt),
[Mediamap](http://chillu.com/299/#mediamap) and the short animation
[“Sport ist Mord”](http://chillu.com/298/#sport-ist-mord). Two of
them are produced with Typo3, a fact that somehow bothers me as I
feel cornered as a “Typo3-Developer”. Perhaps I should do some
concept- and design-work again… The last project is done with Maya,
a tool that fascinates me time and again. But in the end
3D-animation is only a hobby, as I don’t consider myself an
“3d-expert”. And you better be a friggin’ expert to get a job in
3d-business…. By the way: The next six months I will do an
internship at [Scholz&Volkmer](http://www.s-v.de)! And I’m really
looking forward to working with such innovate people – S-V was
always a little dream of mine, and a year ago I not even think
applying at such a great agency. The internship it titled
“Web-Development”, but there’s also much Flash-Stuff in it. These
days I have to write my (Life) in brackets, not much news here…I
hope there will be more to blog about during my daily travels to
Wiesbaden (where S-V is located).
