title: "Expanding my (non-existent) Blogroll"
---
Two of my fellow Media-Production-colleagues started blogging:
[Ben Regali](http://www.benjaminregali.de/) and
[Olaf Schülin](http://olafschuelin.de/wordpress/). Olaf does his
internship in Greece, so he should have a thing or two to blog
about :) Another newcomer is
[Ingo Renner](http://www.ingo-renner.com), my new room-mate over
here in Dieburg. As a computer-science-student at FH Darmstadt he
kinda fits nicely into our geek-house (and it’s just a matter of
time to convert him to a mac-user \*g\*). We just have to
figure out that name-duplication-thing…there can be only one true
“Ingo” – huhuhaha :) BTW: I’m still waiting for
www.emersonaraja.com! Emerson, someday I’ll domain-hijack you and
forward the URL to some pornsite if you don’t register soon ;D
(same goes for www.janheinze.de \*g)
