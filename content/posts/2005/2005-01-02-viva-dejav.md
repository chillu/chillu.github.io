One more reason to completely dump television: “Fast Forward” is
discontinued! Tonight at 23:00 Charlotte Roche will make her last
appearance on the legendary music-show. No more interesting
newcomers, no more funny interviews – just for the sake of selling
more ringtones to stupid kids… If you were lucky enough to have
“Eutelsat” or cable some years ago, you probably know VIVA2 – the
predecessor of Viva Plus. “Fast Forward” is one of the few
remainders of it’s very innovative and interesting programme
(Zelluloid, ZwoBot, 2Rock, hmmm). It’s a shame I didn’t tape
those…only found some short
[trailers](http://homepages.compuserve.de/webliner9/viva2/2woche.avi)
on the web ([more](http://www.viva2clips.de.vu/)). RIP, german
music television.
