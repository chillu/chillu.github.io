I didn’t test Google Maps because somehow it didn’t show up on
Firefox/Mac, but heard a lot about it. And guess what? They did
[Google Satellite](http://maps.google.com/)! You can zoom into the
whole USA with such a level of photographic detail, I’m blown
away…you can literally drag yourself from Manhattan to Sunset Blvd.
in seconds! Go Google! BTW: Did you know Google-Employees are
allowed to work 20% of their time on personal projects, which may
be published via Google Labs? (Link:
[Why work at Google?](http://labs.google.com/why-google.html)).   
I guess Google just entered my Top-List for
“wanna-work-for-them-someday”, which goes like:

1.  [Macromedia](http://www.macromedia.com)
2.  [Google](http://www.google.com)
3.  [Stopdesign](http://www.stopdesign.com)
4.  [Scholz&Volkmer](http://www.s-v.de) (hehe)
