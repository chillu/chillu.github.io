To keep me from falling asleep in mid-day due to jetlag, I’m
compiling some words on my trip. This won’t be a lenghty day-by-day
travel-story, I promise – just some things that come to my mind.
For the record, I’ve been to: San Francisco, Zion National Park,
Bryce Canyon, Laughlin, Las Vegas, Laughlin, Grand Canyon, Sedona,
Los Angeles, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, Carmel.

**Nature** At some places, you can randomly point your camera
somewhere, and every shot seems
[like a postcard](http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/36715938/in/set-779963/)
– nature in California and Nevada is rough, beautiful and always
with a glazing blue sky. At length, it’s even a bit too much –
after seeing so much impressive nature, Grand Canyon was just
“another kinda big valley”.

**Civilisation** I love the way Americans deal with “public
design”:

[weird](http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/38525828/in/set-779963/)
traffic-signage, very colorful storefronts and emergency-cars that
look like they’re out of a museum. Everybody seems to be crazy
about
[giant shiny cars](http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/36716006/in/set-779963/)
– most of the SUVs on the streets could easily transport a Smart in
their trunk…The waste of energy and water is hilarious: It’s one
thing to build a two-million-city like Las Vegas far off in the
desert. But Americans don’t give a damn about recycling their
precious goods, even if they have to import everything hundreds of
miles into the desert: E.g., in most restaurants, plates and dishes
are plastics, thrown away together with dinner-leftovers and
glass-bottles – WTF?!. Another thing: Apple is everywhere!
Windows-laptops are the absolute minority in hotel-lobbys etc., and
you can’t drive two miles without hitting a
[larger-than-life iPod-ad](http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/36716076/in/set-779963/)
– it’s fantastic ;D Then, Americans try to imitate europe whereever
they can: hotels look like english 19th-century golf-clubs, the
waitresses proud themselves with their “coffee from Holland” (I
always knew the best coffee-regions are at the north-sea…**g**). In
Vegas, Malls and Hotels are mini-replicas of Paris or Venice,
complete with
[indoor sunsets](http://flickr.com/photos/73415165@N00/36715963/in/set-779963/)
– just, well…crazy.

**Customs** American breakfast (ham, eggs, sirup, bacon, muffins,
fruits) rocks! I hardly eat any breakfast, but I bet I would be fat
as a whale if all that was common in Germany ;)

**Places** I never thought I would say that…Vegas is the place to
be! I played only once, winning 45$ out of 5$ – I’m hooked ;) If I
ever would choose to live at the U.S. westcoast, it’d probably look
something like this: doing my master at UCSB in Santa Barbara
(beauuutiful indy-student seaside-town), work a few years in Palo
Alto (or Cupertino), win some millions in Vegas and retire in
Sedona (always-sunny and quiet creek-town).

OK, so everything in the U.S. seems to be

– but better? Hm, I’m happy to be back in good old Germany, to be
honest ;)
