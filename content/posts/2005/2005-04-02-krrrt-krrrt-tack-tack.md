The sound of a dying harddrive – more frightening to every
computer-user than any horror-movie. Today my 11-month-old
Powerbook-drive died without prior warning-signs, just like that.
Thanks to [Super Duper](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/) I
have a week-old backup of my whole drive, which boots nicely on my
machine (OSX rocks!). But nevertheless, I’ll have to get this fixed
– which means 1-2 weeks without my machine. In study-times this
would be hell, but hey…due to my internship I have no time to use
it at all. So, what do we learn here? DO YOUR BACKUPS! And do them
continously, even if you have a relatively new drive. It saved me a
lot of nerves these days :)
