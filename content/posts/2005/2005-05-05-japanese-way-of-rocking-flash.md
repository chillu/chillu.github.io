Turn up your stereo (preferably with a bad-ass subwoofer), and
enjoy one of the best Flash-animations I’ve ever seen. It’s called
[Tokyoplastic](http://www.tokyoplastic.com), a design-group from
Japan. These guys really know their 3D/Sound-Tools, and created a
very unique style. Be sure to check out their newest sub-website as
well:
[Tokyoplastic Music Box](http://www.tokyoplastic.com/musicbox.html).
