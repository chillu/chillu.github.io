Our parents probably owned a dozen albums that carried them through
their whole youth – nowadays, I’m already getting bored of the 4392
songs on my harddrive. I’m listening to the same music over and
over again… Time for a fresh approach: Web-based collaborative
listening! The free service [“Last.fm”](http://www.last.fm)
analyzes your musical taste by tracking iTunes (and for all you
interface-masochists: It does WinAmp, too ;). Based on this data,
Last.fm gives you a
[personalized radio-station](http://www.last.fm/user/chillu/).
Unlike [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com) this personalization is
much more than an algorithm: You can join music-groups, build a
network of friends with the same musical taste, you can even tag
music-collections and choose them as your new radiostation! Charts
are generated globally, on a specific country (I always wondered
what people are listening in
[Azerbaijan](http://www.last.fm/place/Azerbaijan) **g**), on a
specific band, tag, usergroup. If I like a new song from my
personal stream, I click on the bandname to get their tags,
usergroups, best songs – well, you get the idea: everything’s
interconnected :) The idea of personalized music is not new, but
Last.fm is probably the first service which really kicks ass doing
it – check it out!
