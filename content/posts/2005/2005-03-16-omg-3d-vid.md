Today I’ve stumbled across this wonderfully thoughtful and
perfectly crafted 3d-short named
[“Delivery”](http://www.delivery.framebox.de/). One of the best
student-3d-films I’ve ever seen – I’ve watched it three times until
now: one run for story, one for textures and one for rendering ;)
And the most stunning: It was made by a media-student over at
[FH Mainz](http://www.fh-mainz.de), as a diploma-work, ALONE!
