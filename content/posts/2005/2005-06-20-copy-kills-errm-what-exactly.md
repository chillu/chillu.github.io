Today I stumbled upon
[a nice comic](http://www.scottmccloud.com/comics/icst/icst-6/icst-6-full.html)
about music-piracy and stuff – interesting and easy read.
[Another article](http://www.ccc.de/campaigns/boycott-musicindustry)
that kept me nodding in acknowledgement was written by the CCC
(Chaos Computer Club) some time ago. While the music industry is
figuring out how to sustain their overblown distribution-channels,
have a look at some free projects:
[Wired Mixter](http://ccmixter.org/by/Wired),
[London Booted](http://patrese4.valuehost.co.uk/londonbooted.htm)
and
[Mercedes Benz Mixed-Tape](http://www3.mercedes-benz.com/mixedtape/mixedtape.html),
which celebrates it’s 1st anniversary these days (and is done by
Scholz & Volkmer, so it’s kinda self-promotion **g**).
