Surfing around on a lazy sunday, I found a couple of links I’d like
to share with you guys. Well, they’re dangerous at least if you’re
a webdesigner like me who keeps thinking “Why didn’t I do this
myself?!” ;).

-   http://www.matthewmahon.com/
-   http://www.motionblur.no/film.php?page=commercials

Most links are from the new issue of
[Wellvetted](http://www.wellvetted.com).
