I’m just buying my sixth and seventh shirt from
[threadless.com](http://www.threadless.com). I don’t know if it’s
just the first rays of sun in Germany, or my addiction to shirts in
general. But hey, they’re so darned cheap (10$ each)! :D Plus, I
can now get my daily fix of well-designed and meaningful clothing
at “[preshrunk](http://www.preshrunk.info), a weblog dedicated only
to shirt-stuff.
