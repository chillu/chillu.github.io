title: "Outage - Teh PAIN!"

Well, switching my blog to [Mephisto](http://www.mephistoblog.com)
was one thing, but taming a fastcgi-server on my
shared-hosting-provider [Site5](http://www.site5.com) is a
completely different story. Being the usual geek, I’ve applied way
too much technology to a simple problem:
[Capistrano](http://www.capify.org/) promises a solid automated
deployment process, and is often used for Rails-based apps. Very
interesting concept, and for more scientific than practical reasons
I’ve spend nearly two days configuring this tool for chillu.com.
Well, i’ve ended up 90% done, and an embarassing downtime while
debugging fastcgi and mysterious rails-logs – sorry for that!
