Leaving Germany next week for more exciting work at
[Silverstripe](http://www.silverstripe.com) in New Zealand, I’m
researching about my travel. With Web 2.0 and buzzword power of
course.

At first i tried a web-app for planning my itinary: just send your
flight-confirmation-emails to [tripit](http://www.tripit.com), and
they provide you with a nice printable travel-plan (with
weather/maps/directions etc.). Unfortunately it didn’t accept the
format of my booking agency, so no dice here (manual entry is way
too tedious). Very handy tool for US-based travellers though!

Then I looked up info about my 2-day stopover in Osaka/Japan on
[Wikitravel](http://www.wikitravel.com) – an incredibly useful
resource, one of the best use-cases of a wiki that i’ve seen so
far. [Seatguru](http://www.seatguru.com) provided me with a nice
[schematic view](http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Lufthansa/Lufthansa_Airbus_A340-600_B.php)
of the A340-600 that I’ll be taking there, showing bad seatings and
wing-positions.

I had a discussion with my family the other day, about me being so
eco-friendly by not commuting by car down in Wellington. They
argued that I produce my year’s worth of carbon-emissions just by
taking the plane down to NZ – which I couldn’t believe. Turns out
it **is** true:
**The [TerraPass](http://www.terrapass.com/flight/products.flight.40000.php?flight_carbon=19751&flight_miles=49968) website calculated that I spend 8,958t of CO~2~ on my 92,538km travel**
(roundtrip with several stopovers). I first thought this was the
*total emissions* for all 340 passengers, but heck no, thats only
my little contribution. The
[specifications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A340-600) for an
A340-600 show that it can take up to 200,000 litres of fuel (how on
earth does that thing even take off?!).

I could go *carbon neutral* by donating around $65 to planting new
trees, according to
[TerraPass](http://www.terrapass.com/flight/products.flight.40000.php?flight_carbon=19751&flight_miles=49968).
Thats quite a bit of money, especially if you think how much good
this amount could do in charity. I’m thinking about factoring it
into the travel expenses though (which everybody should be forced
to do anyway – see the
[Ökosteuer](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ökosteuer) (economic tax)
in Germany).

In Germany, lots of people even do short flights to
Paris/Mailand/Stockholm for shopping costing €10 (made possible by
cheapo airlines and EU-subventions). Definetly puts some
perspective on being so “global”, and travelling across the world.
Another argument for telecommuting/teleconferencing…
