After all the talk about “the real life” on my blog, it is clearly
time for a geeky post ;) Today I’m moving another part of my
digital life online: Bookmarks. I’m probably a bit late to the
party here, but I evaluated the options for quite a while. I wasn’t
too impressed with the feature-set and user interface of
[deli.cio.us]() (besides the fact that I can never remember where
to put those damn dots…). The release of [ma.gnolia]() was more
exciting, providing ratings, private bookmarks, nice typography and
more social features. I’m totally digging (no pun intended) the
concept of tagging, and have been pretty busy converting my “web
1.0”-hierarchy to sensible tags – [take a look](). Apple, can you
please give me a filesystem that natively supports tags? (and I’m
not talking about those stinkin’ smart folders, which are basically
fake filesystem-searches). Two reasons why it took me so long to
make the switch are speed and integration: Magnolia was painfully
slow when it was released in 2006. And I was under the impression
that the process of creating a new bookmark online wasn’t
unobtrusive enough to actually be useable. Thanks to Safari, I call
the ma.gnolia-bookmarklet by simply pressing Apple+1 now, easy as
pie. These days, I’m always wondering what I get back for putting
stuff on the interwebs. One of the biggest advantages for being
active on [last.fm]() is that you get music recommendations based
on your input. It would be great to have these fuzzy
recommendations for all kinds of services, say “People who read
this feed are also interested in” or “People with similar
bookmarks”.
