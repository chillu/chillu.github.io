A quick uncoherent summary of what I’m up to down under: Last week
I met [Diana](http://www.dianakunschke.com/), an ex-workmate from
good ol’ [Scholz & Volkmer](http://www.s-v.de-times). She’s
travelling through Ozzie and NZ with her friend Madleen, and had a
two-day stop in Wellington. We didn’t manage to meet for over two
years, so found it quite funny to sip a coffee on the other end of
the globe :)

Concerning work, I’m pretty much fulltime managing and developing
for an US-based client doing a
[Google maps](http://maps.google.com) mashup, helping to get the
awesome
[Silverstripe 2.2 release](http://silverstripe.com/demo-updated-check-it-out/)
out of the door, and coordinating translators for localization of
the interface. I’m also having a closer look at
[agile development](http://agilemanifesto.org/), a methodology
which helps us to deliver great projects – and is exactly the stuff
that would’ve been helpful to learn during my studies hehe.

Today I’ve had a bike trip to the
[Wellington Wind Turbine](http://www.wellingtonnz.com/SightsAndActivities/The+Wellington+Wind+Turbine.htm),
which towers in the “hinterland” of Wellington. It took some sweat
getting up there, and I’ll definetly won’t feel my legs tomorrow,
but it was well worth the effort: A stunning 360 degree view of the
harbor area, surrounding bays and even the Marlborough Sounds
(northern tip of the south island). Check out the panorama-shot
(requires [Apple Quicktime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime))
