Thanks for all your comments!

Being a programmer, I crouch in front of computers a lot –
obviously you want to avoid being a cripple with 30 and get an
ergonomic workplace. Usually this means having a separately
adjustable keyboard and screen in addition to my Macbook Pro.
Currently i don’t have this luxury, so I came up with a really
simple laptop stand to rise the screen-height and have a more
relaxed wrist position.

Some of them are just clumsy, look bad, or can’t be applied to
Apple laptops because of the limited bending-angle of their
screens. I’m suprised nobody looked at the obvious, and constructed
a stand from a ring-binder. Its very cheap, easy to build,
portable, and in addition contains most of the clutter i need on my
desk (post-its, pen, my two external drives). You can even bundle
any cables through the metal hole present in most binders. And most
important: It perfectly fits the color of my laptop! \*g

#### What you need

1.  A stable
    [ring binder](http://www.nicetoys.com/images/saunders12530_RingBindersm.jpg),
    optimally with the latch not sticking out of the top to prevent
    scratches
2.  40cm aluminium rail (0.5mm thick, 1.5cm depth/height), normally
    used for securing edges, its available in every utility store
3.  40×1cm felt or fabric, to prevent scratches
4.  Double-sided adhesive tape
5.  Two small metal
    [clamps](http://www.bueromarkt-ag.de/bilder/250/28161.jpg),
    normally used for securing letters
6.  Optional: Some black anti-slide mat to cover the ring binder

#### Instructions

1.  Cut the aluminium rail to the length of the ring binder with a
    metal saw
2.  Round the cutting edges
3.  Place adhesive tape on one inner side of the rail
4.  Drill two holes towards the sides big enough to hold the metal
    clamps
5.  Fit rail to one edge of the ring binder
6.  Drill holes through the binder as well, and secure them with
    the metal clamps
7.  Fit the strip of felt on the other inner side of the rail
    (which will hold the laptop)
8.  Secure the sides of the clamps facing the laptop-bottom with
    tape to avoid scratches

#### Warning

If your laptop-bottom tends to heat up with high CPU-usage, a
paper-based ring binder might pose a fire hazard. Consider using an
[aluminium binder](http://www.nicetoys.com/images/saunders12530_RingBindersm.jpg),
leave some room for ventilation, or cut venting-holes into the
binder top.
