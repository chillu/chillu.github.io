Randomness #1: Turns out we were (involuntarily) following the
traces of Sigourney Weaver last weekend, who happened to be at the
[Mighty Mighty](http://texture.co.nz/blogs/places/archive/2006/12/15/mighty-mighty.aspx-bar)
and “Lanes”-bowling wednesday and thursday (we went friday and
saturday) – see
[article](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominionpost/4283333a6000.html) in
the Dominion Post. From now on, I’ll stalk celebrities with web 2.0
power: The local mapping service “Zoomin” actually has a
[Wellington Celeb Vista](http://www.zoomin.co.nz/?group/show_places/9284)
group which maps celebrity sightings haha.

Randomness #2: I could’ve sworn I’ve seen Reiner, an ex-workmate
from german [Scholz & Volkmer](http://www.s-v.de) the other day at
J.J.Murphy’s in Wellington. Haven’t seen him in three years, and
wasn’t entirely sure it was him, him being uncommonly bearded and
slightly broader face. So I walked past after an brief irritated
look. Afterwards I looked him up on various social networks, no
mention of Wellington-travel etc. Now I just got an email from
another ex-workmate [Diana](http://www.dianakunschke.com),
apparently she has seen him down south on the Abel Tasman track as
well – what the… The world is surely a small place.
