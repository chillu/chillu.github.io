One of the few practical side-effects about New Zealand being on
the other end of the world is that you inevitably cross a whole lot
of countries on your way. This meant that an “around-the-world”
flight with several stopovers was only slightly more expensive than
going to Wellington non-stop (1650€ vs 1400€). So there I was,
virtually pointing the finger at my spinning globe in Google Earth,
looking for interesting stopovers. Although I’m a bit sceptical
about high-densitiy areas, the decision fell on Japan – in
specific, [Osaka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka). With a
whopping 19mio people living in the greater area, this should prove
some drastic change from my 750 souls hometown.

I flew into
[Kansai Aiport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Kix_aerial_photo.jpg),
which is essentially a gigantic artificial island 50km away from
the city. First task there: Getting paper-money from my visa. Now,
you have to know that I’m bad at maths. I love my
calculator-widget. Well, the currency-conversion from euros is
pretty strange (1:160), so I horribily miscalculated how much money
I would need for my two days stopover. I’ve changed over 1000€,
about ten times of what I actually needed – and will probably loose
a good chunk just changing back to dollars. Kids, learning maths
can really pay sometimes! ;)

This shouldn’t be the last miscalculation for the day: I was being
thrown in exactly the opposite day/night-cycle, so ended up
sleeping 16h straight from midday till the next morning. After
rigorously studying the subway-plan (thankfully with english
translations!), I’ve endeavoured into the city. In Osaka you have
to look closely to find anything that qualifies for old history,
its mostly concrete and advertisements – quite different from my
last city visit to
[Berlin](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chillu/sets/72157602470458608/),
where you have historical sites all over the place. Tucked away
between highways and skyscrapers you’ll find the impenetrable
[Osaka Castle](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chillu/1899634085/) – a
fortress built to withstand every invasion, with massive 20m
stone-walls and several defensive rings.

I found it interesting that you can find lots of references to
Japans “golden ages” in the middle of the last millenium, but will
rarely come across a mention of the second world war. You certainly
would expect some information in the
[Osaka Museum of History](http://www.mus-his.city.osaka.jp/english_iso-8859-1/index.html),
a skyscraper with 9 floors space. The only reference I could find
was a map of the fire-bombings by the US in 1945, accompanied with
about three sentences of indecipherable kanji (english translations
at tourist attractions are a bit sparse) (turns out there’s a
[Peace Centre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka_International_Peace_Center_%28Peace_Osaka%29)
tucked away somewhere). Second day was dedicated to the more modern
aspects of japanese lifestyle: eating and
[gadget-hunting](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chillu/1899663893/)!
Both not an easy task if you don’t understand the most basic
descriptions in kanji (the japanese character-set). I’ve made it a
bit of a hobby to guess what products are advertised on the subway
billboards (shows you how much graphic design is still dependent on
context/textual information). For eating, it really helped that
most restaurants have a (scaringly lifelike)
[plastic-representation](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chillu/1900498788/)
of all meals in a showcase – its just a matter of pointing at the
right stuff.

So after two days of pretty mild culture-clashes and lots of new
impressions, I was finding myself back on the airport (with 1.7km
the
[longest terminal on the planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_Airport)).
Now, after mostly being the only non-Japanese person wherever I
went (Japan only has 2% foreigners) halfway across both my known
ends of the world, I didn’t particularly watch out for a lot of
familiar faces. You can imagine my surprise when I met
[Conor](http://www.inform.co.nz) in my boarding-lounge (he’s been a
client of [Silverstripe](http://www.silverstripe.com) and we
quickly made friends). Actually he was on the same plane, sitting
two rows in front of me on the same seat-position – what are the
odds?! (being a math-looser, I won’t be able to give you an
accurate answer to this…). After another 12h of flight I was
finally back in New Zealand last Saturday, and basically went right
back to my “old life” (welcome drinks on the weekends, starting
work on Mondays). All feeling a bit like a strange deja-vú at the
moment, but I’m really enjoying to be back!
