Whew, what a geeky weekend: I was in Berlin all the time, well…over
internet-console. Certain circumstances (and a notion of
self-destruction) brought me to reinstall my root-server at
Strato/Berlin, complete with nine (partly commercial) websites and
loads of email-adresses on it. Its about every webmasters
nightmare, and took me one day preperation (backup, user-accounts,
etc) and even more for the new setup. So, again a weekend lost to
web-work – which happens too often in the last months. University
starts again tomorrow, it’s getting fall – and I somehow missed out
the complete summer being heads-down in projects. DAMN COMPUTERS!
