title: "Helvetica R.I.P."

I am in process of compiling some pdf-sheets for my applications
(vita, short portfolio), which need a worked-out typography. I’ve
done some searching for font-alternatives to the omnipresent
Helvetica-Typeface – and found
[“Leapfrogging the classics”](http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/001972.html)
on underconsideration.com (nice design, btw). Check out the
comments as well, lots of experienced guys in there. Short list of
the supposed Helvetica-Killers: Gotham, Interstate, Hoefler Text
(to be contd.). Have to stick to Helvetica for
floating-text-webdesign though…**sigh**
