I’m on telly! This afternoon I was sitting unsuspectingly in our
university-mensa when a TV-team approached our group. Normally I’m
professional at hiding myself from attention, but this time Emerson
shouted “Here, take Ingo!” (Todo: Come up with some payback for
Emerson \*g\*). So I said my twopence about the mensa-situation
(“1500 students vs. 200 chairs”), and was aired this evening on HR,
a local tv-channel (see
[vid](http://www.pixxelschubser.de/fileadmin/vid/mensa_hr/mensa_dsl.mov)).
Hm, ok – I’ve got another 9:40 minutes of fame left in average for
my lifetime (if Andy Warhol is right), and I’m curious what I fill
the rest with. Probably some bankrobbing-car-chase-scenes ;) Btw: I
have to stop saying “halt” in my sentences \*g
