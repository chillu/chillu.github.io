A study-project kinda forced me to finish off the
chillu.com-redesign – and here it is! Colours are a more vivid and
friendly that in the night-theme of the old version. In general
everything is polished a bit: All content is generated by the
Content-Management-System Typo3, the Portfolio-Section is updated
and beefed up. Browser-Optimization is not yet finshed (problems
with IE5 and IE6 \*sigh). Apart from that: Mi casa es su casa! Take
a look around – and please give me feedback!
