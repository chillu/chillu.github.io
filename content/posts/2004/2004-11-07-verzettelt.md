Just returning from a WG-meeting with my flatmates – one of the
rare occasions where all six inhabitants of this house are in one
place. Well, at least five – our newest member, Bertrand, was
missing (unentschuldigt! \*g\*). Apart from this meetings, we
pracise a system of hearsay and notes – especially this week the
whole house was cluttered with about ten notes about noisy
door-banging, shopping-lists etc. My favorite one was a
observation-map to define where all those fck\*ng maggots (Maden)
are coming from in the kitchen. That somehow gives you an
impression of the chaos when six half-grown-ups live together ;)
