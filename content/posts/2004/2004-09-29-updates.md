title: "Updates!"

After finishing the chillu.com-redesign in late june I was really
busy with several projects. Most of them are already in the
works-section, but they will be subject of a different post (too
tired now). So…again under pressure: Applications for my internship
in 2005 are in their making, and chillu.com will be my showcase –
finally it’s useful to have a website :D On the updates: IE-users
rejoice! If you are not already cut off from the internet by
dialers, worms or malicous JPEG-Image (lol, by the way), you now
get the full functionality in the “works”-section (fixed some
javascript-errors). That’s it for today – watch out for more
frequent posts in the future!
