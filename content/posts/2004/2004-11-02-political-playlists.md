Although the U.S.-Elections are not decided yet, the notion of
“Four more Years” of war and lies with George W. Bush gives me a
very sad feeling. My first reaction was to compile a playlist that
expresses this. I’ve done the same thing shortly after the
WTC-attacks. The Songs are (like the rest of my music-collection) a
patchwork through centuries and genres:

-   **R.E.M. – It’s The End Of The World** Well, not quite – but
    it’s irony seems very fitting. I head this track a lot after the
    WTC-attacks.
-   **Blur – Coffee&TV** “I’ve seen so much I’m goin’ blind and i’m
    braindead virtually”.
-   **Pixies – Where is my mind** Especially as a soundtrack to the
    final scene in “Fight Club” this seems very fitting.
-   **Neil Young – Keep on Rocking in the free world** America as
    we like it: critical and patriotic. Just re-discovered that one
    today.
-   **Led Zeppelin – Tangerine** Does not really fit in here, but
    somehow it reminds me of the whole Vietnam-resistance and the
    mentality connected to it.
-   **Linkin Park – Breakin The Habit** Something that most
    Americans definetly need to do.
-   **Presidents of the USA – Video killed the Radio Star** Could
    also be called “Corporate News-Channels killed Journalism”.
-   **Farin Urlaub – Lieber Staat** “Danke dass du mich regierst” –
    satirical view on the german government.
-   **The Streets – The Irony Of It All** Very witty discussion on
    political issues (in UK, but nevertheless)
-   **Thomas D – Gebet an den Planet** Great when you’re desperate
    and dissappointed about idiots reigning our world.
-   **Trevor Rabin – Theme from Armageddon** Somehow this track
    always makes me feel patriotic, which is not an easy thing for
    Germans! I’m aware of the fact that it’s connected to a very
    “american” film ;)
-   **Marilyn Manson – The Golden Age of Grotesque** One of the
    last thinking american patriots – and nobody gets it.
-   **Blumentopf – Das schönste Gefühl** “An diesem Tag hat mich
    das System gefickt – leider hat es sich danach nie wieder bei mir
    gemeldet”
