One of my definitive nominees is:
[“I would RTFM if there was as FM to FR”](http://www.designbyfire.com/000084.html)
over at [designbyfire](http://www.designbyfire.com). 100% ACK! I
should write an article about [Typo3](http://www.typo3.org), but
just the other way round: “I would RTFM if there wasn’t 10.000 FMs
to FR” **g**.
