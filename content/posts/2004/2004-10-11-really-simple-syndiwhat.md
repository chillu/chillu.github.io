RSS stands for “Really Simple Syndication”, which essentially means
you can read content (mostly news and weblogs) off-site in a
standardized format. chillu.com also joins the hype, and for the
whole crowd who already subscribed to my feed (so, essentially
macsepp **g**), I’ve got a new feed-url. There are lots of
applications out there for reading those “RSS-feeds”, such as
Newsmonster ([newsmonster.org](newsmonster.org), Plattform-unabhängig),
NewzCrawler ([newzcrawler.com](newzcrawler.com), Windows) oder NetNewsWire
([ranchero.com](ranchero.com), Mac). On my Powerbook I prefer the latter in its
new incarnation “NetNewswire 2.0” with tabbed browsing – yeah
baby!
