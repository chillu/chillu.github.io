title: "The Roomraiders-Effect"
---
I’ve just watched MTV’s “Roomraiders” on telly, a dating-show where
the candidates are judged by the condition and contents of their
rooms. The thought popped up “What would they find in my room?”
Well, a huge amount of technical gadgets, computer-literature,
clothes lying around everywhere – thats about it. It’s not that I
don’t listen to music, watch good films, collect family-photos –
but everything is stored digitally in my Powerbook, invisible for
any observer. I entrust an increasing part of my cultural identity
to machines, which is very dangerous in times of harddrive-crashes,
viruses, EMPs (ok, perhaps in some years \*g\*). What info will
my grandchilds have about me? I think it’s time to order some
reprints of those fancy digital gallerys… On a global basis I
suppose this century will be some kind of new “middle-ages”
concerning cultural inheritage – we can’t handle the
information-overkill on a daily basis, and we’re far away from
storing it in a persistent readable format for the “after-world”. I
would like to know how long these lines will exist – probably until
the next big Typo3-disaster \*g So long…
