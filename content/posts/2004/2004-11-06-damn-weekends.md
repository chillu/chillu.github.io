Somehow I’ve lost the “weekend-feeling”. What used to be a time of
relaxation, friends and fun is now a strange mixture of work and
too-much-time-on-myself. This thursday (note: our weekend
officially starts thursdays **g**) I didn’t go out with Xaver and
some others to finish a deadline-dreading website instead. OK, no
problem. But somehow I’ve even got a bad concience hanging out with
TV and junk-food on a saturday, because there’s so much to do even
at the beginning of this semester – I don’t wanna imagine how it’s
end will like. Maybe it’s just workaholic, but I think it has other
reasons as well – work is a good distraction from other (maybe more
important) things. As you see, I’ve got enough time to produce
pointless and too thoughtful blog-entries, so don’t worry (yet)
;).
