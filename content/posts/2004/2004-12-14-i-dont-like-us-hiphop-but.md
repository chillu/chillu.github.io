...this compilation really got onto my iTunes-Hotlist: “Jay-Z vs.
The Beatles – The Grey Album” – a unofficial bootleg-album by
[DJ Dangermouse](http://www.djdangermouse.com). You may download it
at [textz.com](http://textz.com/greyalbum/greyalbum.html), although
it’s officially banned by EMI – but aren’t the best things in life
for free? :) There’s also a background-feature at
[WIRED Magazine](http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,62276,00.html).
Encore!
