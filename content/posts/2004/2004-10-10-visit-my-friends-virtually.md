Two new – and long awaited \*g\* – releases of websites: My
former flat-mate Sebastian alias macsepp relaunched [macsepp.com](macsepp.com)
in a very nice css-only design and a rockin’ navigation-scheme. I
wish I also had such a worked out “about”-section. He uses
TextPattern, a promising and simple CMS ([textpattern.com](textpattern.com)) –
I’ll stick with Typo3 though, even if it drives me CRAZY most of
the times ;) Along with this, his g/f Eva published her website
with very clean colors, though lacking a bit of content (sidekick
to eva\* \*g\*). Hope to see some bloggin’ and pics by those
two, as they are in Australia for studies and would \*have
something to blog about. UPDATE: Eva’s Website is offline again,
perhaps I was a bit too fast with my posting ;)
