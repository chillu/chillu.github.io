Speaking of my WG-life: I’m was so damn lucky to get this room!
Currently I’m bloggin this from my window-ledge with my wireless
Powerbook, watching a beautyful clear sunset. At last germany isn’t
this bad, in contrast to study in some strange countries with:

-   2000$-WGs (greets to Andi/Hawaii)
-   Elektrotechnik-Studies (greets to Seb&Corny/Spain)
-   Spiders and snakes (greets to
    [Eva](http://www.evamatthes.com)&[Sepp](http://www.macsepp.com)/Australia)
