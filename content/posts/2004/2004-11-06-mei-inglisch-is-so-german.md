...says Kerstin! She’s one of the few persons from school I
actually stayed in contact with, mostly due to the fact that she’s
as Instant-Messaging-addicted as my geeky self. Check out her blog
at [Livejournal](http://www.livejournal.com/users/dartogreen/),
she’s a lovely person and has a very entertaining,
right-into-the-face style of writing. OK, back to the
bad-english-accusations: If I had a comment-system (something which
is definetly on my long-term-todo-list) I would ask my readers…but
lacking one, i just say: Yeah Kerstin, and your site is
so…errrm…YELLOW! ;D
