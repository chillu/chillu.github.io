With about two years delay the probably most anticipated 3d-shooter
is finally realeased: [Halflife 2](http://www.halflife2.com)!
...And after another three days of downloading 3,5gb of game-data
through Valve’s fantastic “error-try-later” Steam-service it also
arrived at my computer. There are probably better game-reviewers
than me, so I’ll keep it short: Wonderful graphics even on my ol’
Athlon1800 (+ Radeon9600XT), stunning physics (even the swings on a
playground work as expected!). But whats most important: The
gameplay is probably the best ever: Smart opponents, challenging
and very diversified missions and great realistic atmosphere.
Especially the last point is very important to me: At one point in
the game I was like “eeeh, you damn guards, don’t disturb me
watching this sunset” lol (see Screenshot). I’m half through at the
moment, and thats exactly the point where I normally dump games –
I’ve never made it to the big-boss-endgame of
[DeusEx 2](http://www.deusex.com/),
[Doom 3](http://www.doom3.com/), [FarCry](http://www.farcry.de)
because somehow I lose interest after a while. Well, HL2 proves to
be different, as I can’t wait for my next adventure as “Morgan
Freeman”.
