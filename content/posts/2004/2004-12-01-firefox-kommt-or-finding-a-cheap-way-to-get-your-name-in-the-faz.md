Look ma, I’m in the FAZ! At least in teeny tiny letters… FAZ means
“Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung”, one of Germany’s biggest daily
papers. The opensource-community uses this popularity by placing a
full-page-ad in tomorrows edition about
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla-europe.com/de). Through donations on
[firefox-kommt.de](http://www.firefox-kommt.de) of 10-40EUR per
individual the team brought up about 50.000EUR with 2403 donators –
enough for one page of FAZ. Hopefully my donation helped to spread
the word – and convince a broad audience that there is a live
beyond the dark side ;) In case you think that this is a very
stupid reason to donate money to – I will also donate for “SOS
Kinderdorf” this year to keep my good concience **g** OK, thats it
for today…whew, what a media-appearance – I’m a celebrity ;)
