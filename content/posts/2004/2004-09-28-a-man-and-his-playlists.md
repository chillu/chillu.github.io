Sometimes every computeruser is faced with decisions – tonight with
917 to be precise. Being awake with too much coffee and full-moon I
battled against a fierce enemy: the rest of my untagged
MP3-collection. With over 900 ratings per hour (or 15 ratings a
minute whohoo) I am now proud owner of a completely tagged list!
This might sound geeky, but there are a lot of guys out there that
would envy me about it \*g\*. At
[smartplaylists.com](http://www.smartplaylists.com) you can see the
use of such a list: via the (wonderful) iTunes-feature you can e.g.
compile a playlist with all songs that contain “live”, “acoustic”
or “unplugged” to get a great live-concert with all your stars.
