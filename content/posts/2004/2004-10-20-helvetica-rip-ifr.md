I found it! ITC Officina Sans rocks my world! :D Other nice
Sansserif-Fonts which complete the list in my post “Helvetica
R.I.P.” below: Flora, Folio, Frutiger, Goudy Sans, Univers. In the
post I also groaned on the lacking abilities to style fonts online:
With a rather simple idea that lets you bang your head thinking
“why didn’t I…” even this obstacle seems to be sovled. Shaun Inman
presents the
[“Inman Flash Replacement (IFR)”-technique](http://shauninman.com/mentary/past/ifr_an_fir_alternative.php),
which renders any given truetype-font inside a “flash-movie-header”
dynamically. One of the first implementations can be seen at
[Hicksdesign](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk) – one of my personal
webdesign-heroes \*g\*. The site was recently redesigned, but
in major parts “verschlimmbessert”, as we germans would say ;)
P.S.: Everybody who understands the header for this entry IS A GEEK
\*g. OK, enough chaotic posts and nonsense for today.
