Whohooo, I’ve finally got a working commenting-system for my
weblog! It wasn’t easy, and still isn’t perfect, but hey – you can
type in letters which somehow appear on my webpage…good start. Some
boring details: Typo3-wise this is a merge of tt\_news and
chc\_forum, a rather crazy combination (putting up a whole
forum-system for simple comments), and needed lots of
template-rewriting (Thanks to Rupert Germann for his excellent
extension). Feel free to comment on new posts, and if you still
remember something on old posts – go ahead, I’m happy about every
comment :)
