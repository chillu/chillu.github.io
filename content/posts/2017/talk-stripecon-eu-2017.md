Talk at [Stripecon Malta](https://stripecon.eu) in 2017.
I've built a [PoC](https://github.com/chillu/silverstripe-graphql-react-demo-app),
demonstrating the new GraphQL module exposing Silverstripe CMS data
through a simple app built on [React Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/),
and deployed on [Zeit](https://zeit.co) (which has been rebranded to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)).

See [slides](https://slides.com/chillu/graphql-silverstripe-with-demo-app-stripecon-2017)
and [talk recording](https://vimeo.com/252223843).
