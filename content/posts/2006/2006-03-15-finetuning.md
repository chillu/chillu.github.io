Trying to develop after the open-source-principle “Publish early
and often” I’m releasing some “under the hood”-updates to this
website. A new design is on the way, but for today the focus is on
content and functionality. I’m very inspired by the fresh ideas of
[signal vs. noise](http://www.37signals.com), the weblog by
Ruby-on-Rails-creator 37signals – especially one post titled
[“A challenge for 2006: Cut your site in half”](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/a_challenge_for_2006_cut_your_site_in_half.php).
So, what’s been done:

-   CMS-Upgrade to Typo3 4.0RC1
-   more RSS-formats (RSS0.91, Atom, RDF)
-   language specific blog-view ("show only english posts")
-   focus on a single web-portfolio (and a tiny link to "other
    works")
-   updated "about"-section
-   named my "thoughts"-section what it really is: a "blog" (to
    hell with those pseudo-individual wording
-   dumped the "fr33 the pixel"-tagline – I’ve never known what it
    meant anyways…
-   mini-blogroll (with xfn-tags)
-   RSS-feed on recent works
-   improved human-readable urls (RealURL rocks!)
-   temporarily disabled the styleswitcher due to incompatibilities
    with the new Typo3-version

**Update:** Comments are not working…again **sigh**
