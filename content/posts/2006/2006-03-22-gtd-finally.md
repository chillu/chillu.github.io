There are innumerous posts about
[getting things done (GTD)](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done/),
and I spent so much time reading them that I actually didn’t get
anything done ;) So, what would a geek-blog be without it’s
GTD-post – here’s my take on the topic: Organization of your life’s
daily actions basically needs a consistent system. I tried really
basic stuff such as moleskines (handwriting sucks) and text-files
(too unflexible). Then I switched to
[Circusponies Notebook](http://www.circusponies.com/) (no
todo-categories), [Backpack](http://www.backpackit.com/)
(online-only) and
[Burnoutmenu](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/productivity_tools/burnoutmenu.html)
(clumsy UI). All this systems failed for the stated reasons – I
needed cross-platform compatibility in case my Powerbook dies
again, offline-access and an intelligent GUI that does not get in
my way.

After several weeks of testing, I’m still excited about a simple
HTML-tool that now keeps all my todos:
[NextAction](http://trimpath.com/project/wiki/NextAction). Somehow
in my development-life, I missed the fact that webpages can save
data to theirselves via Javascript and
[JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) – I mean, how cool is
that?! By that, you can have a full-blown interactive web-app in a
single file, in the case of NextAction executable in every
Mozilla-based browser. NextAction is really tailored towards GTD,
with action-contexts (a very important principle to learn), actions
for the next X days and human-friendly due-dates (“next month”
instead of 2006/04/01). Of course, it’s interface is freely
customizable via CSS – I’m planning to do a chillu.com-skin for it
;) To make this web-app behave more “desktoppy”, I’m loading it
into a seperate browser (Camino) showing only this page without any
title-bars. By this, I can instantly switch to my todo-list, and
don’t clutter it with tabs of other websites – simple access is
everything.

So, having a functional system that I trust, the only thing I have
to learn is actually implementing good GTD – I still have those
monster-todos floating around in my list that are not “actionable”
in the original sense – they can’t be accomplished in a simple
sitting. I guess I have to do some
[more GTD-reading](http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/GTD)...
before I get things done… **g**
