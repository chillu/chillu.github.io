It probably took some days and about 20.000km of travel to realize:
Wow, I’m really finished, and a new chapter in my life is about to
start. I just graduated from University of Applied Sciences
Darmstadt, after four years of studies. And after a lot of
administrative chaos, I could now print “Bachelor of Arts (hons) in
Media Production” on my oversized (non-existent) business cards.   
In the meantime I spent three months hacking away on my pet-project
and bachelor-thesis “Syndicure” – a web-based collaborative
RSS-reader for info-junkies (more details on the
[developer weblog](http://syndicure.com/blog/)).   
So, next chapter: I’ve never been away from sweet home Germany for
more than a couple of weeks, and it’s about time to change that.
Starting in August, I’ll be doing an internship at
[Silverstripe](http://www.silverstripe.co.nz), in Wellington. New
Zealand. They’re a young innovative company in a vibrant metropole,
so probably a perfect place to spend five months of serious
web-development. Although I still have to look at the spinning
globe of [Google Earth](http://www.google.com/earth) to grasp how
*far away* New Zealand actually is, I’m really looking forward to
this experience.
