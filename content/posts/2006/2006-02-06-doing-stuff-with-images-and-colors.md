Yay, my first OSX-application is ready: “ColorThing” – the outcome
of the “Interactive Ccocoa”-course in my current studies. The (very
creative) title signifies an evenly creative and complex task:
Getting some average colors out of multiple source-images and …
well, save them (into Photoshop-palettes). I know, it probably

[Delicious Library](http://deliciousmonster.com/), but I sure had a
lot of fun doing the interface-design and working with all those
cool OSX-technologies. Thanks to
[Iven](http://www.weissundschmidt.de),
[Carsten](http://www.iverse.org), [Sepp](http://www.macsepp.com)
and [Emerson](http://www.emersonaraja.com) for their support!

ColorThing was a developer build which does not run on other
