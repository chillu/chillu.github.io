Do you still remember
[Al Gore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_gore)? I just stumbled
over a
[flaming pledge for environmental protection](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2565436963450479963)
by this former vice-president of the U.S.. It’s not only a stunning
example of a well-prepared presentation, but also contains very
interesting insights by a man who **nearly** became head of the
american administration – and even if he would talk more moderate
if he actually won the election, there is still hope…   
In fact the presentation was so good that somebody made a movie
around it: [An Inconvenient Truth](http://climatecrisis.net)
([Trailer on apple.com](http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount_classics/aninconvenienttruth/)),
which is released in the U.S. these days (unfortunately we still
have to wait until September to see it in Germany). [via
[Presentation Zen: “Al Gore – another presenter extraordinaire?”](http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/05/al_gore_another.html)]
  
P.S.: Al Gore sits on the board of directors at Apple Computer
Inc., which earns him some extra points of course ;)
