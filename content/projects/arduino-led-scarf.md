An art project was for Kiwiburn 2016 and 2017, the regional Burning Man in New Zealand.
An Arduino Nano powers LEDs in a fully scarf and stylish top hat, with buttons for mode controls. Comes with click-based beat matching and various "drop modes" for maximum awesomeness on electronic music.

This project taught me how to work within tiny compute constraints, and how
unproductive coding in raw C can be! But it also gave me an appreciation
for hardware product design. We had no way to fix hardware *or* software
issues during the festival, so everything was designed with fault tolerance in mind.
