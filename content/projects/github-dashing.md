Dashboard to monitor the health of github projects based on their contribution statistics.
Based on the [Dashing](http://shopify.github.com/dashing) framework (written in Ruby).
This was used for a few years at the [Silverstripe](https://silverstripe.com) offices in Wellington,
as an information radiator. In hindsight, the leaderboard surfaced some hidden heroes,
but also incentivised less productive behaviours. The build dashboard was a game changer,
given the extremely large amount of codebases supported by the teams it focused us on quality
(or at least figuring out why builds are fragile...).
