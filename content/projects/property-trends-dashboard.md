Applied data analysis to my own house hunting back in 2018.
I choose to believe this was a factor in not over-paying for the house we bought
(if that is even possible in the New Zealand market...).

This dashboard is built on [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and the
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language (a proud New Zealand invention!).
## Features

 * Interactive map with dot size mapped to sales price, and dot colour mapped to "% over RV"
 * Filter by neighbourhood
 * Filter by property attributes like floor space or RV
 * Browse tabular data for max. detail
 * Plot sales trends over time (e.g. shifts in "% over RV")
